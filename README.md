# A solutions of algorithms on 7 Billions Humans game using the Swift Language

All the solutions in the game are here using a Swift syntax, but in the game it is very simple, using variables just how inputs. That's why we using a "convert mode", like this:


```
import Foundation

var step: Bool = true
var pickUp: Bool = true
var drop: Bool = true
```
